Semantic Search algorithm that takes an input docx file, splits into chunks, creates embeddings, and does question-answering. 
main.py contains the code.
input.txt is the text corpus.
output_embeddings.parquet is the parquet file created by the program.
The embeddings do not have to be regenerated every time.
